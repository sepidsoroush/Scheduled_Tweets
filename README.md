I built this web application as a learning project for the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) framework.

- Ruby version: 3.3.0
- Rails version: 7.1.3
- Features: Sign Up, Sign In, Log Out, Reset password, Routing.
- Used [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) for commit messages just for fun.
- Learning Reference: [Gorails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkNR1hG4yOk&list=PLm8ctt9NhMNV75T9WYIrA6m9I_uw7vS56)
